Camp Kabeyun is a summer camp for boys located along the southern edge of New Hampshires Lake Winnipesaukee. With 85 acres of land an close to a mile of lakefront shoreline, it's a beautiful location which holds a special place in Will and Mayghen's hearts. When they first met there in the summer of 2008 they were both still studying and trying to decide what to do with their lives. In the ten years since that first summer they have moved across the country, traveled the world, come back together, and fallen in love. They are now delighted to have the chance to share this special place with their friends and family on their special day.

# Pine Point

Pine point is an important meeting place for all the campers and councelors at Kabeyun. It's a place of peace, community, and contemplation. Every Sunday campers and staff gather here to share an hour together and discuss topics important to the group. Each week a different councelor will share a reflection and the campers will have time to offer their own thoughts and share with one another. This point offers a canopy of trees, a beautiful view of the lake, and a deep connection to the place and history of Kabeyun. It's at this place that Will and Mayghen have chosen to make their vows to one another before starting their new life together.

# The Dining Hall

{{< img-post path="/img/" file="dining-hall-snow-crop-1.png" alt="Dining Hall" type="right">}} The camp dining hall serves over a hundred campers and dozens of staff three meals a day all summer. With a big, cozy fireplace and a fully furnished kitchen it's an ideal spot for a wedding reception. In good weather the windows open up toward the lake front and it's a great place for dinner, drinks, and dancing.

# Cabins

{{< img-post path="/img/" file="cabin-2.png" alt="Cabin" type="left">}} Cabins ranging from six to fifteen beds are available for all wedding guests to utilize free of charge. Cabins are located all throughout the campus so they're always close to something intesting. Accommodations are rustic but include twin matresses for each guest. We recommend bringing your own bed linens but we have loners available in case you forget or don't have room to pack. Shared toilets and showers with hot and cold running water are available in detatched structures. Cabins are usually within a few hundred feet of a bathhouse. Separate men's and women's facilities are available.
