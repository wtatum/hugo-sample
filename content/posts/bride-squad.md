It wouldn’t be possible for Mr. William Tatum and Miss. Mayghen Elliott to have the party of the century aka “a wedding” without their amazing squad. These two really considered long and hard about not having a wedding squad, but in the end decided there were a handful of people that really meant a lot to them and they decided to keep the tradition of a wedding party alive. Without further ado please take a gander at the below squad they will represent the many memories these two have shared together, as well as many embarrassing memories they shared during their formative years. 

# Partner in Crime
## Ann-Marie Masiewicz AKA "Annie" or "Ann” 

When asked to describe Annie, Mayghen’s first response was, “just imagine that person you know you shouldn’t look at when in a work meeting because you know she will do or say something to surely make you burst out in laughter at the most inopportune moment.” Mayghen describes Ann-Marie as her personal-shopping-emotional-support, Wine sharing, and rom-com side-kick. Ann-Marie has tolerated Mayghen’s inability to ever make a decision from what’s for dinner to what she wants to be when she grows up. You will often find Ann-Marie enjoying a good beer while slaying some ridiculous trivia, because surely Mayghen has dragged her to a local brewery. Mayghen describes Ann as having an immense amount of patience, always dependable, and an amazing ability to listen. 

# The Entourage

## Angelina Milano

When asking Mayghen about her friendship with Angelina she stated, “Angelina and I go way back.” Mayghen and Angelina have been friends since the  3rd grade. There are far too many memories and inside jokes for her to get into the details. But Mayghen said her relationship with Angelina can really be summed up as one statement: “brutally honest”. Angelina is described by Mayghen as a “bada**.” One of Mayghen’s favorite memories consisted of shopping with Angelina in her early twenties. Mayghen always bought t-shirts with slogans or dorky pictures well into her twenties (we have been given word that this still happens...) however, Angelina played a pivotal role in Mayghen’s wardrobe becoming slightly less juvenile when Angelina informed Mayghen as she picked up another ridiculous T-shirt like, “workout warrior” “you can only buy that if you buy an actual adult piece of clothing”. Needless to say since then Mayghen has maintained “something ridicules, and something I can actually wear to work”.  Mayghen knows that if she ever needs or wants the “real truth” all she has to do is reach out to Angelina. 

## Emmalee Elliott

Emmalee is Mayghen’s youngest sister. Mayghen recounted many memories of watching Emmalee grow up. From her in inability to say her favorite color “lellow” to helping her move into her first college dorm room. Mayghen describes Emmalee as stubborn, “in a good way”. One of Mayghen’s favorite memories was sharing a room with her two little sisters, and unbeknownst to their parents she would play music when they were all suppose to be asleep and perform musical numbers throughout the bedroom, using their bunk bed to perform feats even Broadway would be impressed with. These nights would end with her sisters bent over in laughter and begging for more. Mayghen has enjoyed receiving texts throughout the wedding planning process from Emmalee often stating, “you haven’t done that yet!” or “Meg, you seriously copied my idea!” as some may know Emmalee got engaged about a week after her big sister and basically already has her wedding planned! 

## Hannah Elliott
Hannah (as you guessed) is Mayghen’s middle sister! Hannah Banana as Mayghen referenced her. Mayghen described Hannah as someone who loves deeply and has the most adorable laugh. When Mayghen was little she often got in trouble from her grandmother because she use to believe she was the only one that could understand Hannah and would often speak for Hannah! Mayghen has many fond memories of watching Hannah grow up as she spent many of her nights begging to sleep with her big sister as she frequently had nightmares and Mayghen (mostly) rolled over to accommodate her. One of Mayghen’s favorite memories of Hannah was when she was about six Hannah desperately wanted to cut her hair into a mushroom cut. Hannah arrived home with her mushroom cut and walked around for hours puffing up her hair saying, “Hannah with a haircut” over and over again. Hannah also blessed Mayghen with a beautiful three-year-old nephew Grayson. He walks with a spirit just like his mom and is a spiting image of her. 

## Noelle Handlovits

Mayghen likes to tell the story of Noelle’s first impression of Mayghen.... “who is this chick suddenly following Will around”. Noelle was pretty protective of her female presence among the Prometheus crowd (Will’s workplace for those of you who don’t know).  She had to figure Mayghen out first before she was willing to allow this blond chick to be part of their friend group. Fortunately, Mayghen and Noelle realized they loved to make fun of the guys and both enjoyed a glass of wine. Soon both realized that more woman made it way easier to out number the opinion over the musical/movie choices during the many get-togethers this group has. Mayghen was quickly able to convince Noelle to join her runners cult and since then the two have supported each other through more than 17 races and countless aches and pains. Mayghen describes Noelle as a caring, amazing baking, fasionesta!  

## Shane Elliott

Mayghen’s big brother! Mayghen had plenty to say about her big brother, she said he is like a pineapple. Hard and prickly on the outside, but really just mushy on the inside. Mayghen has some typical older brother, little sister stories. The typical annoying little sister just wanting to hang out with her cool older bro. Mayghen and Shane’s relationship grew stronger during the high school years, and when Shane joined the military and was stationed in Jacksonville, NC she moved down to hang with her big brother for a few months. One of Mayghen’s favorite memories with her brother was spending countless hours building the best lean-to possible amongst the rocks and in the woods of their backyard. Shane was the first to bless his sister’s with their first nieces and nephews. First Gavin (11), Gabe (7)  and Addyson (2). Shane married his beautiful wife Sabrina in 2014 and Mayghen became an aunt all over again to Ryan (14) and Ashton (9).
