How did this adorable couple come to be? It depends on who you ask. If you ask Mayghen it was love at first sight way back in 2008 (major eye rolling took place writing that sentence). If you ask Will it was when Mayghen paid for his pizza and offered a beer as well. He declined the beer (it was just a day after St. Patrick’s day) but Will confirmed the old adage of the way to a man’s heart. Whichever answer you chose it’s easy to see that these two really love each other.

Will and Mayghen first met at Camp Kabeyun the summer of 2008. Will was a “burly armed mountain fiend” aka a hiking counselor and Mayghen was “ACG” aka arts and crafts girl. In that first summer the two didn’t cross paths often, but they had a few day off adventures, including to New Hampshire’s Arathusa Falls. Their next summer Mayghen upgraded to “swim mistress” and Will’s knees were a year older and creakier from all those miles hiked but no sparks were flying yet.

Will entered the grown up world a little quicker than Mayghen, starting work as a software engineer. Mayghen took a gap year between her undergrad and graduate year and spent a few months living with her brother Shane in Jacksonville, NC. During Mayghen’s third summer at camp (her maternal grandfather told her she had Peter Pan Syndrome) she found out Will working in Amsterdam and had been there for about six months. Mayghen crafted her sneak attack on this unsuspecting young lad and set out on a month long visit with their good friend “Johnny Cash” aka Jon Byrd. Cash and Mayghen arrived in Amsterdam October 2010 where they rendezvoused for the month of bike rides, frites, Heineken and memories.

The story gets long and boring from here. Mayghen and Will fell out of touch, with only the occasional Skype chat. Mayghen ended up at summer camp for another two summers for a grand total of five. She followed some “other boy” down the east coast to none other than Raleigh, NC! Mayghen thought five years at an all boys camp would prepare her for moving into a house with four guys but a girl can only take so much before she starts to crack. Six month later she was looking for a change.

This is when Mayghen came a-knocking on the door of the only people she knew in North Carolina’s door – the Dashs. If you ever find yourself in need there’s no better place to find yourself than perched on their doorstep. Mayghen still remembers standing in their doorway with her backpack on and Laura Howard-Dash—not missing a beat—saying, “put your stuff down and and climb up on this scaffolding and help me scrape this popcorn ceiling”. Needless to say, Mayghen house sat for the summer as the Dash’s continued to frolic in the woods of Kabeyun.

Mayghen found herself lonely, 1,000 miles from her friends and family, when she suddenly recalled a strapping young buck she hadn’t spoken to in over four years. Enter stage right: Will Tatum. Mayghen hopped on Facebook and sent over a message to Will asking if he was still mucking about in Raleigh and would he be interested in grabbing pizza at Ruckus. Those of you who know Will can understand that this is where the universe had plans for these two. Let’s be honest, Will never uses Facebook, let alone checks his messages. As stated above the universe knew where this “pizza” meeting would end up. Neither of them knew where they would be four years from first sharing some awkward catch up chit chat over pizza. Maybe Facebook isn’t so terrible after all, and thank goodness it was pizza that brought them together and not some fancy steak or seafood because four years down the road that would make a way more expensive wedding dinner!

Well folks thank you for hanging in there and reading how you got stuck sitting in the woods, smacking mosquitos, and eating pizza. Mayghen and Will are excited to share with you the next chapters of their lives and hope you enjoy help writing new and exciting memories.
