## When are things happening?

The ceremony is at 3:00pm on September 8. The site for the ceremony is about a half mile walk from the parking area (assistance available for those who need it) so please leave extra time. There will be activities available for those arriving early.

## What should I wear?

Dress code for the wedding and reception are business casual. If you're arriving early or leaving late feel free to relax the rest of your stay.

## Where can I stay?

### Kabeyun

All overnight guests are welcome to stay at Camp Kabeyun free of charge. We have access to camp for the entire week of the event. Please indicate in your RSVP if you're interested in staying at camp. We'll be reaching out to "campers" with additional information once we have a sense of who is staying.

### VRBO

The area surrounding camp, especially Wolfboro, has a significant number of vacation properties. [VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/) is a great resource for accessing these properties and prices are good in the off season. Search for Alton Bay, NH 03810.
